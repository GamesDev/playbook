Any sale will go through a portion of the following pipeline;

1. **Prospect**; a prospect is a contact that may have a project for us. It may come referred from a friend or someone who came to us.
1. **Lead**; once we've established that there is indeed a project opportunity, we refer to it as a lead. Most of the time we skip the "prospect" stage since we get contacted directly about our services or a specific project.
1. **Qualified**; if a need is a fit for us (goal, technology, resources, timeline), we move a lead to "qualified" and finish collecting all the information we need from the client to prepare an estimate.
1. **Negotiating**; once the client received the estimate, we often negotiate terms (price, scope, timeline).
1. **Won** or **Lost/Rejected**; either we come to an agreement with the client or we don't. Whether it's because the client refuses our terms ("Lost") or because we decide it isn't a fit ("Rejected").
1. **Revisit**; prospects or leads are sometimes delayed

A few comments on this;

- We do not do military (e.g. surveillance software or weaponry related software/hardware), porn, political and religious content.

as we get directly contacted receive direct inquiries from existing clients, by email, through project form entry on the site, by phone call, or people coming directly to our office.

1. **Connection**; anybody we know and/or are talking to. These may be friends, partners, former clients... They may have projects down the line or lead us to people who do.

To track our connections and the sales pipeline, we use [Streak](https://www.streak.com/), a CRM tool for Gmail.

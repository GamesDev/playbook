## Introduction


Welcome to the Wiredcraft team. Our Company believes that recruiting and retaining talented people is the most important factor in our ongoing success. In order to ensure that all team members have a constructive experience working with Wiredcraft, we work to create the clearest understanding possible between the Company and its team members.  To help all team members understand the Company and its operations, the Company's management has developed this Handbook.

The information in this book is critical to better understanding the Company’s organizational structure, business activities, corporate culture, policies and procedures. The detailed procedures and policies provide guidelines for cooperation that help all of us to work together as one team. 

## Purpose of the Employee Handbook

1.  This Handbook is designed to provide background on the Company and provide information about working conditions, benefits, and policies affecting employment with Wiredcraft.

1.  This Handbook, and the rules and conditions it contains, also serves as part of the agreement between the Company and the Employee, along with, but separate from, the individual employment contract. Signing the employment contract also means accepting all procedures and policies in this Handbook, so please be sure to read it carefully. If any team members have questions regarding the contents of this Handbook, they should first discuss with his or her direct supervisor. If questions remain after consultation with the direct supervisor, then the team member may contact the managing director. Each team member is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with the provisions of this Handbook. In cases where the individual employment contract and the Handbook overlap, the version contained in the individual employment contract will take precedent.

1.  The Company reserves the right to modify the contents of this Handbook as circumstances require. Any memos or emails from Company management regarding policy or procedures of the Company with regard to its Employees and their rights and responsibilities are to be considered additions or amendments to this Handbook and should be kept by the Employee along with the Handbook. Company management shall be fully responsible for final interpretation of the contents of this Handbook. 

1.  The information contained in this Handbook applies to all Employees of the Company. Following the policies described in this Handbook is considered a condition of continued employment. However, nothing in this Handbook alters an Employee’s status. The contents of this Handbook shall not constitute nor be construed as a promise of employment or as a contract between the Company and any of its Employees. 

1.  Wiredcraft's objective is to provide all team members with a work environment that is constructive to both personal and professional growth.

## Application of the Employee Handbook

1.  This Handbook is for all Employees of the Company. Policies, rules and regulations in this Handbook apply to all Employees unless other terms are specified in their individual employment contracts. 

1.  **Changes in Policy**

  Since the Company's business and the surrounding legal and competitive environments are subject to change, the Company reserves the right to interpret, change, suspend, or cancel all or any part of the Company's policies, procedures, and benefits at any time. We will notify all Employees of these changes. Changes will be effective on the dates determined by the Company, and after those dates all superseded policies will be null.
  
  No individual supervisor or manager has the authority to change policies at any time. If any team member is unclear about any policy or procedure, then he or she should speak with his or her direct supervisor. If policies remain unclear, the team member should consult with the Managing Director.

  If there is any conflict between the English version of this Handbook and its Chinese translation, the Chinese version supersedes.

## About Wiredcraft

1.  **Company Profile**

  Wiredcraft is a 100% foreign owned company incorporated in Samoa as WIREDCRAFT LIMITED.  Hereafter in this document Wiredcraft may be referred to as “The Company.” Our Company was founded in 2009 to deliver Web related services to both Chinese and foreign markets.

1.  **Company Mission**

1.  **Five core values**

  Building for the long term: We always assume that every relationship that we enter into is for the long term and that we conduct ourselves and our business in such a way that Employees, customers, partners and co-workers will want to continue to work with us for years to come.

  **Excellence**:  We come to work everyday to build a great company, not just to gain another paycheck.  By providing our clients with the best possible services, we can build not just the best Drupal shop in China, but one of the finest in the world.

  **Systems That Work**: For Wiredcraft to work for all its members, the Company relies on organized systems.

## Training

In order to ensure the ability of each Employee to contribute to the company and to open up opportunities for advancement to all members of the team, the company invests heavily in training its Employees and encourages each team member to take advantage of the job skills and other training programs provided by the company.

1.  Wiredcraft's training program is open to all company Employees, from senior managers to entry-level staff. The company relies both on its own team members and, where available, outside resources to provide the training necessary to ensure each member of the team has opportunities to advance in their career with Wiredcraft.

  1.  Each Employee will receive one to two weeks initial on-the-job training upon joining the company.  This training will include both training on their own specific job, and experience working with each department of the company to become familiarised with the company's overall business.  The exact duration and composition of the the training program will depend upon the Employee's role and the discretion of their supervisors.

1.  In addition to the initial on-the-job training, the company will conduct periodic training on job specific skills such as sales and customer service, general management, team-building and intra-company communication.

1.  Specific recommendations for training may be made by supervisors during the performance appraisal process. Opportunities for training will only be available to team members receiving acceptable performance reviews during the Company's performance appraisal process.


## Employment Policies and Conditions
1.  **Open Communication**

  No member of management is too busy to hear suggestions or complaints.

  Wiredcraft's management aims to provide an environment where the Employee can get the problem solved quickly, openly and without fear or reprisal. This open communication policy gives each team member the chance to appeal unresolved work problems through the levels of management, from his or her direct supervisor, and to the managing director if the issue is still not resolved to his or her satisfaction.

1.  **Governing Laws**

  The labor laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China and Shanghai are the governing legislation in respect of all employment conditions with the Company.

1.  **Non-discrimination**

  In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Company will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. The Company does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices because of race, skin color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.

  The Company will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.
	
  Employees with questions or concerns about discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their supervisor. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal. Anyone found to be engaging in discrimination against the Company's policies will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
  
1.  **Nepotism** 

  While the Company appreciates referrals of relatives, we cannot hire when there is or will be a direct or indirect reporting relationship between the parties. In addition, any Employees applying to work for the Company must disclose any relatives currently or previously employed by the Company.
  
1. **Non-fraternization**

  Personal relationships between Employees have the potential to disrupt the work environment and interfere with the efficient implementation of the Company’s business. 

  Any personal relationships between members of staff must be promptly disclosed to the direct supervisors of both staff. 
  
  If a personal relationship creates conflicts of interest, causes dissension, interrupts the workflow of the parties or other Employees, or creates a negative work environment, the employment of one or both parties may be terminated.

1.  **Confidentiality**

  The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and success of the Company. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following items:
	
  Compensation data
	
  Financial information
	
  Marketing strategies
	
  Pending projects and proposals
	
  Proprietary production processes
	
  Personnel/payroll records
	
  Conversations between any persons associated with the Company
	
  Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business information will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not benefit, directly or indirectly, from the disclosure of the information.


1.  **Health-Related Issues**

  Employees who become aware of any health-related issue, including pregnancy, should notify their supervisor of health status. This policy has been instituted strictly to protect the Employee.
  
  A written “permission to work” from the Employee’s doctor is required at the time or shortly after notice has been given. The doctor’s note should specify whether the Employee is able to perform regular duties as outlined in his or her job description.

  A leave of absence may be granted on a case-by-case basis. If the need arises for a leave of absence, Employees should notify their supervisor.
  
1.  **Obligating the Company**

  Only authorized persons may sign agreements in the name of the Company. No Employee whose regular duties do not include purchasing shall incur any expense on behalf of the Company or bind the Company by any promise or representation without written approval from the Finance Manager or General Manager. Nor shall any Company sales representatives bind the Company to any liability except with the prior approval of their sales manager.

  Business Hours
	
  Company business hours are:

  Monday through Friday

  09:30 AM - 12:00 Noon；01:00 PM - 06:30 PM

  The Employee is requested to arrive in the office at such a time that they are ready to begin their duties at 9:30 AM. Failure to report to work on time will result in disciplinary actions and will be reflected in the Employee’s performance review.

  In case the Employee is unable to report for work on time or he/she must be away from the job due to an emergency or a sudden illness, he/she must notify his or her supervisor in the morning of the schedule’s working day. If the supervisor is not available, the Employee shall leave a message with his or her supervisor or another member of his or her management team for delivering the message.


  In the event that the Employee anticipates that he or she will be late for half an hour or above, he or she must notify his or her direct supervisor or other department member to convey the message.

1.  **Attendance and Punctuality**

  To ensure that we all function as a team, it is important that punctuality is maintained by all Employees for all official duties or functions. In the case that an Employee fails to report to work within 15 minutes of the scheduled starting time, unless for weather reason officially announced by the local government, the following measures apply:

  Fifteen to thirty minutes late: The Employee must fill out a late report stating the reason for failing to report on time and provide it to their supervisor for signature.  The supervisor must then submit the late report to the Human Resources department for filing.  This procedure may be waived at the supervisor's discretion.

  Thirty to ninety minutes late:  The Employee must fill out a late report stating the reason for failing to report on time and provide it to their supervisor for signature.  The supervisor must then submit the late report to the Human Resources department for filing. In this type of case, the procedure is not subject to waiver by the Employee's supervisor.

  More than ninety minutes late:  Will be counted as an unexcused absence, a late report must be filed for the Employee's personnel file, and the Employee will be counted as having taken one day of unpaid leave.

  Employees are expected to achieve an attendance record of 95% or better in a 60-day calendar period. An attendance standard of 95% means that team members are expected to have no more than three attendance failures within a 60-day calendar period. 

  An attendance failure includes:
	
  An absence from work
  
  Failure to arrive for work within 15 minutes of the scheduled starting time

  Failure to return to work from a break or meal period as scheduled
  
  Leaving work prior to the end of the shift without management authorization

  If an Employee is late to work due to illness for less than two hours, then the Employee shall notify their supervisor.

  If an Employee is late to work due to illness for more than two hours then the case should be treated as an absence (sick leave) and the sick leave procedures should be followed.

  If an Employee is absent due to illness for five days or less during a year, then the salary for days missed due to illness will be fully paid upon production of the relevant medical treatment record with certification by a medical doctor.

  If an Employee is absent due to illness for more than five days during a year but within the medical treatment period allowed by law then, regardless of any certification provided, the Employee shall only be paid 50% of the salary, bonus, commission or other benefits that would normally be due to the Employee for the days absent in excess of the five day limit.

  If an Employee is absent due to illness for a period that exceeds the maximum legal period for medical treatment then the Company may terminate the Employee’s employment with the Company.

  If an Employee is absent due to illness for more than two days, the Employee must provide a physician’s certificate that indicates the nature of the illness and the recommended period of leave required. If the Employee cannot provide such a certificate, he or she must use the annual leave to offset the absence. 

  If the Employee is repetitively late due to illness and the requested sick leave periods are less than one day, the Employee must provide a physician’s certificate that certifies the reason for the chronic sick leave. 

  If the Employee cannot provide a doctor's certificate, then he or she must use annual leave instead of sick leave.
  
  Every sick leave absence must be documented in the leave application form and approved by the Employee's department manager. The approved leave application form should then be forwarded to the human resources department for leave administration and record.

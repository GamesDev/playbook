[Blog posts are at the core of our marketing strategy](/Several-mediums); they're the main asset driving traffic to our website and a key element when pitching clients. Getting a consistent stream of blog posts from creatives and developers is very challenging, but crucial to our activity. 

We religiously stick to the following process:

1. **We keep a [schedule of upcoming blog posts in a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wiredcraft.com/spreadsheets/d/1_OSIn3Kv9BQBwH7SB390JxrAj3eC0WYq2VDTYmqoG5M/edit?usp=sharing)**. We plan several months in advance.
1. **Any post for the next 4 weeks is on a strict schedule**;
  1. **4 weeks out, the writer picks a topic**. This topic may change later.
  1. **3 weeks out, the writer needs to have a produced a "brain dump"**. *See [step 1 of "Blogging in 3 steps"](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/blogging-in-3-steps/).*
  1. **2 weeks out, the writer needs to have "skeleton" for his post**. *See [step 2 of "Blogging in 3 steps"](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/blogging-in-3-steps/).*
  1. **1 week out, the writer produces a final draft for editing**. From there on, the editors work on polishing the post and adding illustrations.
1. **The marketing team has a weekly editorial meeting with the current writer** to build up the expectation and provide guidance through the various steps. This is particularly important in the last 2 stages of the process to make sure that the post we produce tells a good story.

## Main groups

There are 2 principal groups of users: **Active users** and **Inactive users**.

What define active vs inactive users depends on the product. For example in Octokan we define inactive users as people that did not signed in since 30 days.

* **Active users** always consider they know the product so **do not try to sell them things**. Always push for them **to try new things** such as a new feature or a new product.
* **Inactive users** are much more delicate to handle. They will likely not remember everything about the product and what it does. The focus should be on what the product does, what is new and why they should use the product again.

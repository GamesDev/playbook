A step by step description of the Sales process: what tools we use, when to use them, what to ask for each of the leads' stage, etc.

### Outlining the lead

Note that we always need to have to know the **5 W**:

* **Who?**: who are you reaching out.
* **What?**: what is the meeting/project/call about.
* **Why?**: why do we need to interact (where is it in the sales funnel).
* **When?**: when will this take place (email, office, Skype, etc.).
* **Where?**: where will this take place.

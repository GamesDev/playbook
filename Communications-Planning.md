Each project should have an associated Communications Plan which is shared with all team members, WCL and clients. We can follow the template below and adjust as necessary.




TEMPLATE

# Communications Plan

We will fill in the plan to map existing communications channels then review to see if there is anything we are unaware of or missed. We should regularly revisit this communications plan at the weekly team meetings to limit the potential for communications problems.

# Low Level 
Each github repository has an 'issues' section which cover the following topics: 

| Repo name | Description|
|--------|--------|
| repo-one | Description|
| repo-two | Description|


# Terms table
The purpose of this section is to align on different terminology used by WCL internally and the client. 

|Client|	WCL|
|-----|-----|	
|Gateway	|Proxy	|

# Github issues workflow

The repo's mirror the technical separation of components and some features may overlap several repos  In this case we will create separate issues for each repo  make them related issues  

We can add issues to repo_name for initial discussions (most likely in the deep backlog) and then PM will split them up as the issues develop. 

Each repo will have milestones for the issues which will break down what is delivered in each release.

# Weekly digest

To get a comprehensive view and understanding of the ongoing project, a digest of last week and this week important items.

The list of receivers of the weekly digest is as follow:

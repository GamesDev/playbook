Very simple advices based on various blog posts describing with metrics what works and what doesn't, as well as personal experience on teddy.fr and devo.ps:

- **Submit at 8:00 AM EST**. If you miss the window (after 8:20 AM), simply post the day or week after.
- **Preferably on Wednesday**. Weekends front page are easier to land for example, but Wednesdays seem to be the peak of traffic for HN (more eyeballs).
- **Have a great title**. That means being relevant and catchy, use capitalization and potentially use slang (very effective way of grabbing one's attention).
- **Be opinionated**. Having a strong opinion about something will help create some level of discussion and buzz among readers, which helps getting upvotes.
- **Be relevant**. HN is a community of hackers and entrepreneurs, so either post about entrepreneurship, technology or the related lifestyle and interests of such kind of people.
- Now there are a couple rules to how upvotes work on HN:
    - **One upvote per IP address**. This means that if we're all voting from the same IP (for example at the office), it just won't be taken in to account. We also need to **submit the story from a different IP**.
    - **Direct links to the post don't allow people to vote**. The link we have at the bottom of the post for example (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5200847) don't work for upvoting. We need upvotes to be made from the [newest page](http://news.ycombinator.com/newest) or the [front page](http://news.ycombinator.com/).
- Knowing these rules, here is how you should try and schedule an HN submission:
    1. **Put the name and the direct URL**, no URL shortener.
    1. As soon as submitted, **share the newest page link (http://news.ycombinator.com/newest) on Twitter, GTalk, with your friends on IM and ask for an upvote**.
    1. **The Wiredcraft team should log in using their mobile internet plan and vote (no wifi, remember the IP rule) at more or less the same time, either that or connect from home** (likely to happen as it should be posted around 9:00 PM local time),
    1. If you start being front page, **update that link to the front page link (http://news.ycombinator.com/)**,

HN doesn't care where you're post is coming from, and doesn't care who you are. It only cares about the velocity at which you collect upvotes. Depending on the velocity of other front page stories you may land on it too. Once you're on it, your content becomes more important, however you don't need that many votes to get there if they happen to be given quickly after your submission and close to each other.

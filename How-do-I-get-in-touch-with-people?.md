1. Profile and define your target companies.
2. Use social hacking in order to get a contact, such as
  * using you primary and secondary networks.
  * using LinkedIn to find a meaningful contact (look for IT directors, CTO, etc.). If you do not find the full name in Linkedin, Google the name and company, the result should display the full name.
  * use Google to try to find the direct email address (for example; John Smith Nike email).
  * you can check the found email or create the email such as `first_name.last_name@company_url` and check its validity using online tool such as [Verify email](http://verify-email.org/).
  * you can also check on Facebook using the email adress to see if it returns a result that fit.
3. If you can not find any people to contact, look for a contact email. Try to look for the more specific one as possible (for example *IT-contact@nike.com* over *contact@nike.com*).
4. Create a Lead in Base with your contact point.
5. Prepare the cold email following;
  * make sure to point out a referrer if any.
  * provide a link to an existing work or previous partnership.
  * keep it short and concise.
  * provide the next action (a phone call or meeting).
6. 3 days after it is necessary to check in (something around the line of "Just a quick email to see if you had the chance to review this?")
7. A week after it is necessary to check in for a last time.

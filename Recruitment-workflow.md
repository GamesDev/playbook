We are moving to [Streak](http://www.streak.com/) as an add on to Chrome. I invited you to the pipeline called Recruitment.

The dashboard view in the Recruitment pipeline allows you to;

* **Access the email** which provides a breakdown of the activity (more about this below).
* **Change the stage** to follow users in our workflow.
* **High level note** mainly if anything is important.
* **Assign it** to a user who has access to the pipeline.
* **Provide position** which give a quick overview which position they are applying for.

When working on a specific profile, you can;

* **Access the email**, in the grey bar
* **Change the information**, Stage, Notes, or Position.
* **Participate to the discussion** in the feed (note the *Viewing all activity* / *View only comments*). 
* **Easy access to the docs** in the panel in the right.
* **Add a reminder**

Make sure to own the profiles you are looking for and make frequent scan through them. A profile should be contacted or rejected under 48 hours.

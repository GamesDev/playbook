* **Type of content:**
  * introduction of new technology
  * opinion of certain topic (within industry or just some social phenomenon)
  * share of latest news 
  * useful knowledge or tools,etc.

There is no solid data to support what kinds of content are most popular, but judging from the popular Weibo of some IT companies, above which are the most common seen types.It will be more responsive if we can add our ideas and comments.

I think our followers favor more practical knowledge or tools,etc., so we should post more content of this kind.Since most of our followers are at 20s and 30s. They are more interested in something amusing and even weird.To cause followers' attention, we can post something more argumentative like a hot issue. And I think its important to have more interaction with VIP bloggers and other bloggers with more than 1000 followers.

* **Schedule of the posts:**
  * -8am-9am before work
  * -1pm-2pm around lunch
  * -5pm-8pm after dinner
  * weekends

which are the most responsive time periods.Especially after dinner and on weekends,people are more willing and relaxed to interact on Weibo. Since Weibo can **set a fixed time** to post, we just need to prepare the posts in advance.

* **Number of posts per week/day:**
Based on the current tendency, the growth rate is slow, so I have increased the post frequency to 3-6 posts a day.

Weibo has the word limit of **140 words**, and we should post **bilinguially**, so there usually not enough space for such a bilingual paragraph. Hence, we post two same posts in Chinese and English respectively.And I am trying to translate the meaning as specific as I can.

* **Goal of followers for the next 6 months (Mar.-Aug.):** 
  * Each week: 5 more followers
  * Next 6 months: 100-120 followers

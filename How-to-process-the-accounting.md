The accounting allows us to prove to the government how we are using our money and calculate the respective **taxes**. There are 2 parts;

* **Bank accounting**; covering our expenses, transferts and payments processed by the bank.
* **Cash accounting**; covering our cash expenses.

It must always come after the **[payroll has been processed](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/wiredcraft.com/wiki/How-to-process-the-payroll)**. Note that **everything we buy** we need to **have a fapiao** (cash or online payment).

**Tools**

In order to provide the necessary papers to process the payroll, we are using;

* **Assistant computer**; contains the necessary template and previous payrolls.
* **Government computer**; contains the necessary tools to officialize the papers we submit.
* **Dropbox**; hosts all legal documents, licenses and templates.
* **Online portal of Bank Of China**; the portal of our chinese bank, it has to be **open with Internet Explorer**.
* **Bank Of China branch**; our branch for the company account at Bank Of China. It is located at **No.139 Rui Jin Yi Rd (close to Changle Road) / 卢湾区瑞金一路139号(长乐路瑞金一路)**

1. **Keep it Simple** avoid complex & lengthy posts.  Engagement with posts tends to favor those with single, clear ideas.  If you have a larger, more complex idea, break it into chunks and spread it out over a few posts.

1. **Dump your ideas**; list what you think are the points you will make. Simple bullet points and draft notes are enough at this stage. Things need not to be coherent.

1. **Organize your thoughts, find the leading idea**; now that you have the high level ideas and raw material, you should try to organize it around your leading idea. Find the one argument you're trying to make and start fleshing out your material, much in the same way you would be [[Writing issues, comments and milestones]].  Make sure your thoughts are all centered on one main idea.  If you have multiple points to make, it's best to break them up into multiple posts.

1. **Context**: this is what leads to your idea. It often is the description of a pain point. Let's say my post is about backuping strategies, I could start by telling an anecdote illustrating the danger of not having one ("the server's HDD crashed and I lost all of my data").

1. **Teaser** (optional): after providing the context, you can outline the main issue or idea you want to discuss through the post; "There is never a good reason for NOT systematically building backups".

1. **Development**: that's where you go into detail through the various arguments for your idea.

1. **Closing argument** (optional): you sometimes won't need to bring a closing argument in your post (very technical posts for example are rather light on that side as the meat of the post is the *development* section) but it's usually better to end on a closing statement.

1. **Work on your title**; this is the first bottleneck in converting your viewers into readers. Your title needs to be catchy and as descriptive of the result. Capitalize your letters & use foul language if needed ("Sh*t", "Kick asses"...).

1. **Keywords**: try and put as much of our keywords (see [[Marketing brief]]) in the content. If we're after secondary keywords that are not in that list, do so too.

We keep a list of potential [[Blog posts (ideas)]]. We usually get started with dumping our ideas on [Hackpad](http://hackpad) and then start fleshing out the actual post in the `_posts/_drafts` folder of the site (remember to also set the `published` flag in the YAML header to `false`).

Before publishing a post, have it reviewed by a few colleagues and friends, especially if you're not a native English speaker.

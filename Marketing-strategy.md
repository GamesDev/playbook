*The following set some of the priorities for both inbound and outbound strategies. For more details about how we frame this discussion, see the [[Marketing brief]].*

### Goals

Ultimately, we are trying to improve two types of conversion:

- **Client acquisition**.
- **Recruitment**.

To do so, we need to :

* Increase our online visibility.
* Position our brand as an international company headquartered in SF with an office in Shanghai.
* Establish our technical and creative chops.

### Actions

#### Inbound

1. **Blog posts**: 1+ post per week on internal blog (wiredcraft.com/blog), about events, OSS projects, client projects,... Repackaging of internal documentation *a la* [37Signals](http://37signals.com‎). Add social buttons for easy of sharing.
1. **Open source project**: Open Source 1 project per month (however small). 
1. **Events**: *Shanghai OS meetup* and *Hacker + Founders meetup* (and others like 沪JS/Jing.js).
1. **Newsletter**: One newsletter per month (end of the month), with news about technology (events we participate or organize, technology we are exploring and blogging about...) and projects we delivered or clients we worked with.
1. **SF**: Advertise more our presence in SF; events, blogging... 
1. **PR**: One article per quarter about our work or our founders in a publication of any sort; online blog, print magazine... push for major publications (Wired, Business Insider, etc.).
1. **Networking**: Go to 2 events a month, network and create new connections within the local digital communities (SF + SH).
1. **Social Media**: build followship (mostly for recruitment and tech validation) on:
    1. **Twitter**, **Google+** & **Weibo**: at least once a day, mostly to illustrate our company culture and create followers in the tech community. Follow others, and comment on their posts, etc. be active to build quickly build followership. (Invest in pushing important tweets.)
    1. **LinkedIn+**: less casual, more focused on company updates; open positions, projects...
1. **Build a distribution list**: collect emails to push out website and event updates. (Offer a special case study or blog post for those that sign up).
1. **Blog aggregators**: Register blog to Feedly, Bloglovin, etc. to build up readership
1. **Create link-baiting opportunities**: Create guides aka. long informative blog posts (proves you are a leader in the industry), infographics/visuals, videos, interactive modules, and more.
1. **PPC campaign**: Pay to get introduced to potential clients.
1. **Incentivize sharing**: create perks for sharing a post, retweeting a tweet, opting to be in your email list. Or host a giveaway.

#### Outbound

1. **Cold emailing**: Settle for a template email we will send to all clients of potential partners (IDEO, G2...) and competitors (Development Seed, ...). Personalized outreach temples can be tested to increase open, click through, and conversion rates.
1. **Recruitment**: Recruit 1 marketing (could be local, needs experience in online marketing) and 1 sales (most likely native English speaker, may even be US-based).
1. **Referral**: Pressure contact hubs (connections with large or valuable network) to introduce/refer us to others.
1. **Contact back clients**: Should be done at all time. Potentially find a solution to automatically mail back people after a certain amount of time or at given dates (end of fiscal year...).
1. **Partners**: Develop relationships with potential digital partners in town (W+K, IDEO, Frog, G2, Nurun...).
1. **Remarketing**: cookie, or collect information from non-converting visitors. Remarket in the form of email, call, ad, others?
1. **Guest blog posts**: Provide value to other websites (bi-weekly or monthly) – build links, reach their audience, and increase PR.
1. **Past client testimonials**: Can be used as unique content on the wiredcraft.com website, or used in blog posts.
1. **Featured by influencers**: many online entrepreneurs have podcasts or create videos of interviews with people in the online/technology space. Ask for an interview, this shows we are leaders in our space, earns a high quality link to the website, and will send traffic from the influencer’s website to ours.
1. **Feature an influencer**: Interview an online expert in your space, same benefits as above.
1. **Get referral clients (affiliates)**: Create relationships with other services in the same space but not direct competition (complementary business is best), ask them to refer Wiredcraft when their clients are need of services that we provide.
1. **Philanthropy**: Lend services to a influential non-profit or educational center in exchange for them to talk about us on their website, emails, social, & others. 
1. **Apply for awards**: Winning or even getting nominated for a award will increase brand awareness.

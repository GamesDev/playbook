## Summary
To help everybody in the company grow both technically and professionally and to achieve our company goals, we need to define quarterly objectives and evaluate each team member's performance during the last quarter. 

Teams will have SMART objectives which we can track and use to measure team performance, and team members will have individual goals (may or may not be SMART, this is up to each manager. This is because specifying individual SMART goals for each team member is complex and takes time)
You can find the rationale behind the current evaluation method in this hackpad: https://wiredcraft.hackpad.com/Performance-Evaluation-ideas-sWLDmR4lxt8

## Evaluation Process

**Before evaluation period**:
The managers will work together each quarter to define SMART goals for each project (E.g. 'Increase test coverage to 60% for the XYZ project by next evaluation period'). More info on SMART goals can be found at the end of this document. They can discuss goals for individuals and these can be SMART or loosely defined as needed.

**Individual Assessment Meeting Preparation**:
Managers will assess each team member using the following agenda and record feedback in the template given below. Prepare the template in a google doc for this team member and prepare upcoming individual goals for them so that you can discuss and fill the template in during the meeting. Go over each team member's previous review doc ahead of each meeting and make sure you have the previous individual goals and team SMART objectives ready to discuss.

**Individual Assessment Meeting Agenda**:

_Part 1: Team_

Review Team SMART objectives: Go over team goals with the team member and cover how the team performed in the last quarter. Gather any individual feedback. Cover how well the team as a whole performed and what objectives still need to be achieved. Introduce new objectives for next evaluation period and get the team member to agree to this. If needed, have a short meeting with the whole team about the new objectives in order to make achievable objectives that they will agree to.

_Part 2. Individual_
* Discuss what went well since the last evaluation and their previous goals.  
* Acknowledge changes made by team member based off previous feedback. 
* Review continuing goals and progress, add any new  individual goals.
* Ask if coaching is needed for further development.

Give team member a voice, let them speak what’s on their mind. You can prompt discussion with questions like:
* “Is there anything you would like changed in the team?”
* “Is there anything you would like changed in the company?”
* “Is there anything preventing you from doing your job, or that would help you do it better?”
* “How would you describe the progress of project XYZ?”
* “Would you like me as a manager to change anything about how I work?”


**Recording performance for later review**

Managers can use the following simple template to write down their thoughts during the evaluation meeting for each team member. We should use a single Google Drive doc for each employee as this information should not be public on hackpad:

**Team SMART objectives**: Thoughts on team objectives, ideas, improvements and concerns

**Start doing**: Review goals, improvements and any training/personal development activities

**Keep doing**: Recognise good work and positive work practices

**Stop doing**: Raise awareness of bad practices and highlight areas to be improved.

Ideally managers can review this list at regular intervals and use this list to track personal development progress and remind team members of the points when needed.


## S.M.A.R.T. objectives 
We will use S.M.A.R.T. criteria to help clearly define and outline team objectives. Below is the definition of each criteria.

* **S**pecific: objectives should simply and clearly define what need to be achieved without ambiguities. It answers the five 'W' questions:

  * What: What do I want to accomplish?
  * Why: Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal.
  * Who: Who is involved?
  * Where: Identify a location.
  * Which: Identify requirements and constraints.

Bad example
Improve Javascript skills and take a larger role in our js development
Good example
Work on at least 3 projects using technology X and Y. Show how you used these technologies to solve real business problems. Write at least 2 blog posts about current trends in X and Y.

* **M**easurable: objectives have to be measurable to provide a tangible criteria to gauge the progress and do not leave room for misinterpretation. It answers the following questions:

  * How much?
  * How many?
  * How will I know when the objectives are achieved?

* **A**chievable: goals should be pushing you to further your skills while being attainable and realistic. It answers the following questions:

  * How can the goal be accomplished?
  * How realistic is the goal based on other constraints?

* **R**elevant: it is necessary that the objectives defined are relevant to the employee as well as its position. Keep in mind that relevant objectives when met will drive the team and organization forward. It answers the following questions:

  * Does this seem worthwhile?
  * Is this the right time?
  * Does this match our other efforts/needs?
  * Are you the right person?
  * Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?

* **T**ime-bound: a target date and milestones will provide the necessary velocity for the objectives to be completed. The objectives need to be framed in a realistic timeline with enough time to reach them, but not too much that it drags on. It answers the following questions:

  * What can I do today?
  * What can I do two weeks from now?
  * What can I do two months from now?
  * When should I act on things?

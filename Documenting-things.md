Types of documentation:

- **`README.md`** (mandatory): bare minimum, needs to be dropped in every piece of code (main repo + sub-modules).
- **Inline comments** (mandatory): of course, comments in code are to be expected.
- **Reference** (mandatory for APIs): for API and/or library, using Carte and referencing the full scope of available functions/methods/attributes.
- **Documentation**: architecture and main concepts that don't fit in the `README.md`, just a bunch of `.md` files in the `docs/` folder.
- **Wiki**: ideation, concepts, "user" facing documentation (the user may be a developer). Mostly a reference kept internally for development and/or marketing.

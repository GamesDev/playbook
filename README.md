This is a proof of concept for the Wiredcraft Playbook (and potentially ClassyDocs).

## Run the damn thing...

1. Install [gollum-site](https://github.com/dreverri/gollum-site) (it's f*cking Ruby, so of course you'll need to make sure that you use a version < 2.0)
1. Install the dependencies:

        bower install
        npm install

1. Run it: `gollum-site serve --watch`
1. For the assets: `gulp development`

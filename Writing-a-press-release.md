Press releases have a common structure that need to be followed. It is necessary to outline those points to make sure we are published.

### E-mail header

* **E-mail subject**; the subject line should be short and to-the-point or it will be treated as Spam by the reader.
* The header should be engaging and relevant to the copy
* Some words that spam filters catch can be viewed on [HubStop's Blog](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30684/The-Ultimate-List-of-Email-SPAM-Trigger-Words.aspx)


### Content

* **Release date**; the preferred release date for the publishing platform (`FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE` in capitals if it is released at once).
* Press release’s should be sent at peak Internet traffic hours of the targeted audience. Studies conducted for eDM focused on B2B marketing has shown that the beginning of the week has generally shown high levels of engagement. Tuesday preforms the best over all the other days of the week.
* **Headline**; usually follows the e-mail subject. It should include the company name (and letterhead/official company logo), product name, version, and the key words that describe the announcement. As bold or variable font size are not used in an email, it is capitalized.
* **Secondary headline** *(facultatif)*; one sentence synopsis of the announcement
* **Lead paragraph (5 W's)**; the idea behind this is to write a story (did we solve a problem for somebody for example). We need to follow Who/What/Where/Why/When.
* **About**; provides information about the company. Use some metrics if possible.
* **Contact details**; name, email, cell phone, website, twitter, etc.
* **The "hook"; Important and engaging content, above the fold of the email. 

### Attachment

* **Word document**; it is good practice to have the press release as a word document.
* Email open and delivery rates may decrease as Spam filters are set up to remove emails with attachments and users are known to delete them before reviewing the content as emails with attachments are notorious for carrying computer virus.

### Notes

Keep in mind the following points;

* What's the story?
* Attention-grabbing but accurate headline
* Include hard numbers
* Include assets
* Short, sweet and get right to the point
* Include a quote
* Proofread!
* Personalize and familiarize
* Send it Tuesday to Thursday

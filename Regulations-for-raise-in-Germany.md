Regulations on raising an employee's salary:



* Long-term raise of salary

 - If the employer wants to raise an employee's salary long term, an amendment contract (Ã„nderungsvertag) between the employer and the employee needs to be set up. 
The amendment contract is not a new contract, it is a addition to the original contract.
It makes sense to adapt it every quarter / half year (or even longer).
 - The accountant needs a copy / scan of the amendment beforehand so that the information can be adapted for the salary statement. 

* Bonus
 - It is payed once in a while (e.g. for Christmas), that means it is not a long -term raise of the employee's salary.
 - the accountant needs to be informed beforehand (via E-Mail is enough) every time a bonus will be payed.
 - a bonus must be taxed.

My major though on the cash bonus is as follow:  

*Cash bonus are nice at the time but are just a bit of water into the monthly cash flow of the employee. Something tangible or some memories have much more impact.*

I propose to have some material gifts, such things as follow:

* A small gift that the employee will want such as an iPod, a nice mouse, headphones, etc.
* A coupon for some places such as some arcade, pool, etc.
* A 2 person coupon (employee + SO) for SPA or so.
* Advantages such as half a day, a day of holidays on top of the rest.

For a team it could be good to do something such as the following:

* A voucher for a dinner.
* A night out for some drinks.
* Tickets for a movie.

I believe for each of the case we should find something that fit the bill and have it ready for the post-mortem. I propose the following breakdown keeping in mind bonuses need to be accepted by the direct manager or CTO and COO.


Type | Work | Amount
---- | ---- | ----
Inidividual | Service | 250 RMB	
Inidividual | Product | 200 RMB	
Team | Service | 150/head	
Team | Product | 100/head

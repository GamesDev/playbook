It should not be the case but sometimes it happens. Find below how to deal with late payments.

### Social Security

1. If we haven`t pay the social security too late, we need to pay some overdue(fine for delaying payment).
2. Go to the Social Security Department to pay the money and correct our contact information.They need a certificate which the Bank of China has sent to us,and also need our official seal and social security card to confirm some information.(The staff there will guide how to do it.)
3. We need to write an application to cancel the Instruct Correct and stamp on it.
4. After we pay off all the money,the Instruct Correct will be cancelled automatically.

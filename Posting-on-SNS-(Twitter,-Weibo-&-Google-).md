### Overview

Twitter and Weibo are powerful tools to immediately share brief thoughts, comments and information with other users.  Tweets and Weibo posts are linked to other, similar content through hashtags which are used to categorize content.  

**Things to remember:**
* Remember to use relevant hashtags to categorize content
* Reference other users to create interaction and increase visibility to potential followers
* Avoid posting too many messages in close succession, rather spread posts out over time
* Be sure to share the content of other users 
* Remember these platforms are two-directional, respond to tweets about Wiredcraft, participate in conversations and share others' content.
* Tweeting/Weibo-ing more frequently can positively affect search engine optimization
 
###Sharing Content
* Messages are short, so make sure they are catchy, succinct and have meaningful content.
* Spend a few minutes to see which possible hashtags are the best
* If sharing photos or URL's, be sure the rest of the message includes an engaging reason to click on additional content. 
* Tweet/Weibo regularly to avoid stagnancy and loosing followers

###Using Hash Tags
* Use hashtags to draw reference to conversations taking place on similar topics or with similar content 
* Remember to always check hashtags that you are thinking of using to avoid potential double meanings and to select those that are more popular at the moment. 
* Avoid using too many hashtags, stick to a few (aprox. 1 - 4) relavent, quality hashtags
* Note that Hashtags in Chinese surround the term (i.e. #什么＃）

###Interacting With Other Users
**Messaging @OtherUsers**
* Always reference other users with their @NAME if possible
* If another user has a good idea or another company has a good product, dont' hesitate to give them recognition for it.

**Sharing Others' Content**
* Share quality content that is at least tangentially relavent and will be appreciated by Wiredcraft's followers.
* Sharing content from other users can build followers and increase online interactions, which are good for building clout.  

**Responding to @Wiredcraft Messages**
* Engaging other users can increase follower numbers
* Responses help keep an account from seeming like a robot

**Joining in Conversations**
* Don't be afraid to jump into conversations if there is something relevant to share
* Voice opinions, but avoid harsh phrasing that could cause backlash from other users

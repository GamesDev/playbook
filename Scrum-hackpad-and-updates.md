We use the scrum methodology to keep track of our daily work.

Each project has a scrum hackpad which each member must fill in daily. The hackpad contains for each team member what they did yesterday, what they will do today and any blockers. At the top is a summary of the whole team and this can be posted to the client in the project slack channel daily.

For each project the PM will gather the team daily for a scrum standup meeting.
At the start of each meeting the PM should mention any issues affecting the whole team, remind the team to fill in the scrum hackpad document and chose a random team member to start the scrum. The team members will talk one by one clockwise about what they did yesterday, will do today and any blockers.

For each project there should also be a weekly scrum where members from the client team and WCL go through the same scrum process with a focus on blockers and actionables.

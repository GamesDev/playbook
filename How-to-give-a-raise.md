In order to define the amount of the rise it is necessary to assess;

1. **Work delivered** with its respective manager(s), assess his work delivered. Namely;
  * quality of the deliveries.
  * quality of the communication.
  * reactivity to tasks.
  * initiatives.
  * work ethic.
2. **Team inclusion** with the managers, assess his inclusion in the team. It can be outlined by the;
  * level and quality of communication.
  * use of his skills by other team members.
  * reactivity to changes.
  * overall behavior in the company.

After the assessment is done and it has been agreed the employee should received a raise, define his new position in the [salary grid](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/wiredcraft.com/wiki/How-to-recruit-somebody#sidenotes).

In order to addend a raise to the contract of an employee, it is necessary to;

* Update `Addendum_Employment_Contract-EMPLOYEE_NAME-YYYY_MM_DD` with the new salary and signing date.
* Stamp and sign 3 copies (one for the employee, one for the safe and one for the company).

### Monthly dinner

We need to organize a monthly dinner for the team and for special events (festivals, big contracts, new employee, etc.). Monthly dinner are taking place in the Thursday of the last week of the month. We will alternate from one month to the other from ordering and going to a restaurant.

The schedule for such dinner is as follows:

* **2 weeks before**: send the invitation in Google calendar.
* **1 week before**: send a reminder to everybody and list who be attending.
* **1 day before**: validate attendance list and order food.

At its core, marketing is mostly played on a few mediums;

- **Content & Media**; the most important part of our effort into building an effective marketing plan. These are mostly blog post and videos (e.g. videos). This is the main way we attract and win potential clients and recruits.
- **Events**; we organize monthly meetups (e.g. [Shanghai UI/UX](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-UI-UX-Designers-Meetup/)) and yearly conferences (e.g. [JSConf China](http://jsconf.cn)). We also participate to and speak at other events (e.g. Barcamp). Events are a great way to meet face to face with people and put our brand out there.
- **Email**; we send a weekly newsletter and are implementing drip campaigns for new subscribers (including job applicants and clients). Email still is one of the most effective way of advertising content.
- **Social networks**; we maintain an active presence on various social media (Twitter, Weibo, LinkedIn and Facebook).
- **PR**; we actively work on getting coverage from other outlets, including traditional press.

All of these mediums are tied up to activities that are supposed to establish our brand and demonstrate our expertise and trustworthiness ([a key thing to win new businesses](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/wiredcraft.github.io/wiki/Sales-101)).

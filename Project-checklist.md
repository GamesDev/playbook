## Kick-off
At the beginning of any project, the PM should go through the following checklist to put standard processes into practice and fill in the standard plan templates in the project wiki.


* Start a github and create associated repos for the project or ask the client to set this up depending on how they want to work. Make sure all actors have their necessary permissions.
* Create a slack team for this project and appropriate channels. Make sure everyone is added to the correct channels.
* Fill in the communications plan[link wiki template] and keep it up to date
* Start having daily scrums with the development team and make sure they fill in the scrum hackpad at the end of each working day [template]
* Set up a weekly meeting with the client team. This can be over skype or face-to-face if they are in Shanghai. Keep in mind time differences.
* Send daily updates to the appropriate slack channel of the current summary of the scrum hackpad [link example screenshot]

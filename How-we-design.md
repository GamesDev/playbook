*The following provides details for the specifics of design development, however most of [[Our development process]] also applies too (SCRUMs, agile methodology, reliance on Github...).*

### Things to keep in mind

* **Move as fast as possible and iterate**,
* Work on as few elements as possible in graphic softwares,
* Focus on layout, typography and colors, details will follow,
* **Content and function drive the design discussion**, not the other way around,
* Steal ideas from others,
* Work in the open: post your progress in whatever form (screenshot/pictures) on Github,
* **Actual doodling/drawing, may this be on paper or a whiteboard, should always be the first step**,

### Process

We usually design in 3 major phases:

1. **Information architecture**: lists the different bits of data/information we will make available through the interface. It often relates to either data models in the backend (user profiles for example) or description of UX concepts (e.g. "sidebar" and "main menu").
1. **Wireframes**: wireframes build on the information architecture. They intend to draft the layout and main UI elements, in the form of doodles/drawing of varying details and quality. We often simply stick to hand drawn wireframes, photograph them and upload them on Github but are sometimes required to do "clean" wireframes with a graphic software for client work.
1. (Optional) **Application flow**: we sometimes spend time designing an application 
1. **Mockups**: wireframes provide a direction for designing our UI elements and layout. Mockups are fleshing out the colors and aspect of the various UI elements. We tend to prefer working on the color and a few key elements and then move directly to mocking things up as a set of HTML, CSS and JS files rather than build a static set of mocks.

Within or across these two phases, we usually drive the discussion in the following order:

1. **Logo**
1. **Layout**
1. **Typography & Colors**
1. **Graphic details**

### Tools & Resources

* **[Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)** is a good replacement for Illustrator (vector drawing).
* **[Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/)** is a good alternative to Photoshop for bitmap design (though it now supports vector drawing, much like Photoshop)
* **[The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com nathanbarry.com/webapps/)** is a great resource for vector illustrations (think icons).
* **[IcoMoon App](http://icomoon.io/app/)** is a tool we use to build `@font-face` fonts for icons. It also showcases a great collection of icon sets (Entypo, Iconic...).
* **[Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)** is a great read and explains a lot of principles we stick to.
* **[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com)** obviously, great to keep up with design trends, "steal" ideas and also potentially meet other designers or potential recruits.
* **[UI SDC](http://hao.uisdc.com/)** has a great collection of (Chinese) resources.
* **[Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/stories)** tries to be the equivalent of Hacker News for designers, aka a list of links submitted and voted on by a community.
* **[Sidebar.io](http://sidebar.io/)** is a curated list of bookmarks.

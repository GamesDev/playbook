When a new salesperson is hired the following accounts need to be created: 
- Email
- Base

**Email**
Before the salesperson is given her email account, the appropriate managers should be given admin access to the account. 

**Base**
The salesperson's Base account should be fully accessible by all managers. However, the salesperson should only have access to her leads, contacts, etc.

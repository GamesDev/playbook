A case study is a good material to engage clients and provide more insight in our projects, processes and insights on a particular user oriented problem. It provides the client with a reference on how we could solve their problem.

### Structure

We will have the following structure (directly taken from [this source](](http://www.newfangled.com/rethinking_the_case_study));

1. **Summary**: This is a brief introduction of the engagement, with an emphasis on problem and outcome. It should sell the reader on the value of digging further into the details of your solution. Think of it as an elevator pitch (if not something Tweetable). If a prospect only read your summary, would they at least understand what you did and the value you believe it offered?
2. **Backstory**: Think of this as the beginning, the once-upon-a-time part. You're setting up the case study by providing an introduction to its key players — you and your client — and your respective points of view. Remember, how you describe this relationship will make it easier or harder for a prospect to imagine themselves in a similar relationship with you.
3. **Problem**: This is the simple part. What, exactly, were you hired to do? This hits on your expertise and your diagnostic and problem-solving skills.
4. **Solution**: What did you do? This covers your process, your strategic prowess, your technical capabilities, your team dynamic, your style.
5. **Outcome**: What were the results? Did you build a new audience? Strengthen and grow an existing one? Increase sales? Great. Data, please.
6. **Reflection**: If a reader has stuck around to this point, you can trust them with a bit more vulnerability. Here's where you share the insights and voices of individual team members — planners, designers, developers, even your client — through brief, focused reflections on the job. What worked? What didn't? What doubts did you have? What surprised you? What would you have done differently had you more time or more knowledge at the beginning? What did you learn and how will you use that knowledge in the future? This, really, is the most important and substantial piece of the puzzle for a prospect. If they're seriously evaluating, they've probably heard plenty in the problem → solution → outcome department, but your honest and sincere reflection upon it will be what helps them get to know you and want to work with you.

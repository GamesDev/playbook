## Information

Hi XXX,

Following on what we discussed about, let me quickly list some of the clients we worked with in the past year;

* **World Bank**; we have been supporting their team to implement new features of their open data platform (http://data.worldbank.org/) as well as migrating existing components to a new API centric solution.
* **UN OCHA/ReliefWeb**; we launched the ReliefWeb website (http://reliefweb.int) with Development Seed beginning of last year and have maintained and extended it. We also worked with them to implement an API as well as supporting their mobile application.
* **Embarq**; we developed a large data visualization platform to leverage the BRT data from WRI's and their partners based around Dropbox folders (http://brtdata.org/).

Some additional projects we've been working on since end of 2010;

* **2011 Southern Sudan Referendum**; we built the platform to collect votes and registrants of the referendum. Me and some of my staff directly worked on the ground in Juba (Sudan) with the IFES and ended up building the official results site; http://southernsudan2011.com/.
* **CNN**: we've been helping them to scale, extend and architect their Asian platform, CNNGo (http://www.cnngo.com/), for the past eighteen months.
* **Population Council** (http://southernsudan2011.com/); we're currently building a data tool for their DataUncovered initiative (http://www.datauncovered.com/) with a focus on search, data visualization and leveraging 3rd parties API (including the World Bank).
* **Zinch** (http://www.zinch.com/); we helped Zinch relaunch their community of 3.5 millions users on Drupal. We covered most of the challenging coding and provided consulting, training and expertise on performance and scalability for a site that contains more than 10 millions user messages and 20 millions nodes.
* **PopCap Games** (http://www.popcap.com/); helping them with building a wide scale community (http://popcapworld.com/) that is supposed to merge all their existing games and gamers platforms.
* **Axel Springer** (http://www.axelspringer.de/); consulting (Drupal, optimization and scalability, project management), and training of their local team for one of their projects in China (http://autobild.com.cn/).

This should give you a rough idea of how we structure our prices. We're open to discuss your project and would be glad to set up a meeting with you to discuss your requirements. If you have any question you can contact me via Skype or email.

Best,

### Cold emailing

_Competitor portfolio_

Hi XXX,

I seem to remember that you guys have been working with XXX. Since we are working in the same field, I thought I'd drop you a note about my team.

I am with Wiredcraft, a company working on data visualization, Big Data, API and software consultancy. We are currently working with the United Nations, the World Bank, CNN among others. You can find references of some of our work at http://wiredcraft.com.

I'd love to have the opportunity of talking to you or one of your colleagues about how we can help you with some of your ongoing projects.

Let me know when we could meet, either at your Shanghai office or over the phone.

Best,

_Cold approach_

Hi,

I stumble upon YOURCOMPANY and I thought I'd put you and my colleague Ronan, who is in San Francisco, in touch.

I really liked what you did on LOOKBLOG, we work ourselves a lot with SKILLS with various clients (many of which in the International development space; World Bank, UN, WRI...). Ronan is currently setting up some presence on the east coast and would likely be interested in meeting with you.

Best,

#### Accounting

Hi XXXX,

I was going trough our accounting and I could not found any records of a payment related to your invoicing. If any of these amounts have already been transferred, let me know the date and exact amount of the transfer so that I can cross them out of our accounting system. If you have any question you can contact me via Skype or email.

Best,

Any other actions to be taken by Wiredcraft will be billed to the client according to the consulting fee of the needed profile.
* **How long will I expect to wait to receive my estimate?** We are working actively to make sure you receive your estimate under 48 hours. However depending on the scope and outline of the project, it could take longer for us to draft the correct strategy.

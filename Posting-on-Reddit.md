A lot of points are similar that what you need to do for other platforms (Hacker News, etc.). There are however a few points that should be kept in mind: 

- **Submit between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM EST**. This is the peak moment (people start to loose attention and go through Reddit before work or their lunch break).
- **Preferably on Monday, Wednesday or Thursday**; those are the peak days to post. Other days, redittors usually work. Friday and weekends are out of the picture.
- **If you post a picture use imgur.com**. Other platforms are not well accepted by the community, especially those using the Reddit Enhancement Suite, which is the majority of redditors.
- **If you post a video use youtube.com**. Same reasons as the pictures.
- **Choose a subreddit carefully**. Reddit is divided on subreddits that are usually specialized. Choose something relevant such as [/r/webdev](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev), [/r/devops/](http://www.reddit.com/r/devops) or [/r/sysadmin](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev).
- **Provide at least 10 upvotes**. To make sure it does not fall down in the mist of Reddit, it must first receive the first 10 upvotes as quickly as possible.
- **To cross post add `(x-post)` in your title**. To make sure you cover all the relevant subreddits, you can cross-post the post. Take good care to not spam  too much, or spreading the post across too many subreddits. It can be good to cross post with different accounts at the same time.
- **Do not spam**. Posting the same content from too many accounts at the same time is perceived badly by Reddit.
- **Redditors tend to investigate things when they are not happy**. They will get through all the posts, cross post, comments, etc. Anything they can to see what is really happening and who are the people doing it. If they are really unhappy, there is the possibility to be judged by a sort of tribunal in Reddit for malicious actions (yes it is true) and be banned, resulting in all all links being removed from the platform.
- **Be active and answer to comments**. Redditors love to go through comments and give their opinions, and in many subreddits trolling is not accepted. This usually leads to interesting discussions.
- **Remember your audience**. The average redditor is young, skeptical, liberal, geeky, internet-literate, and ever-so-meta audience. Make sure what you provide is catchy.
- **Submit it manually**. Redditors usually catch the automated posted content and do not appreciate it at all. If you cannot do it manually, do not do it.
- **Have a great title**. That means being relevant and catchy, use capitalization and potentially using slang (very effective way of grabbing one's attention).
- **Be opinionated**. Having a strong opinion about something will help create some level of discussion and buzz among readers, which helps getting karma.
- **Be relevant**. as any community in a subreddit, so either post about entrepreneurship, technology or the related lifestyle and interests of such kind of people.
- Knowing these rules, here is how you should try and schedule a submission:
    1. **Put the name and the direct URL**, no URL shortener.
    1. As soon as submitted, **share the newest page link on Twitter, GTalk, with your friends on IM and ask for an upvote**.
    1. **The Wiredcraft team should log in using their mobile internet plan and vote (no wifi, remember the IP rule) at more or less the same time, either that or connect from home** (likely to happen as it should be posted around 9:00 PM local time),

Reddit loves when somebody is posting original quality content at regular intervals. Some people can disagree with the content of the post, but proving original content is always well seen by the community.

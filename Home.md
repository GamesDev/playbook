**Welcome to the Wiredcraft wiki!**

Here, the Wiredcraft team collects guides and documents of all sorts related to our internal activity: development, marketing, sales, blogging... 

If this is you first day at Wiredcraft, go have a look at the **[[Getting started]]** section to get an overview of what we use and how we work. If you're a developer, we'd also recommend you read the bit about our [[Our development process]] and our [[Coding styleguide]]. If not, then maybe the [[Marketing brief]] and [[Sales brief]] will be of interest to you.

If you have an interesting idea for a project (software, events...), feel free to talk about it openly with us and add it to the [[Ideas]] page. We also collect useful softwares in the [[Tools]] section.

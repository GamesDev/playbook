**This is the Wiredcraft playbook**.

It is intended as a high level description of how we get things done. It should help you navigate our common knowledge and resources.

We organized it in chapters for to the main topics or activities our team deals handles. Each chapter is organized in two sections: a few pages going through high level concepts followed by an FAQ that answers more specific questions about our tools and processes.

If you're part of the team, you'll want to read through it. If you have suggestions or things you'd like to add, just edit away and let the team know on Slack (it's a friggin' wiki after all).

If you're not on the team, then maybe you can find a thing or two that would be useful for your own team.

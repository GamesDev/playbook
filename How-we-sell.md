We're mostly nerds at Wiredcraft. And nerds tend to think that to be good at sales you need to be naturally extroverted, charismatic, socially gifted... This is actually completely off. Anybody can do sales, it only takes a few things:

- **Be trustful**; the best kind of clients (the only kind we want) are people who want to work with us because they trust we'll do a great job.

It lets them think big and potentially be big.

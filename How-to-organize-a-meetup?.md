TL;DR Best Practices for hosting a meetup including, timeline, first steps, how to use meetup.com, and what to do the day of the event to keep yourself sane. 

## Meetup Timeline 

- 6-8 weeks before: Create your [goals and think about your ROI](https://docs.google.com/a/wiredcraft.com/document/d/155b4pW-H_5t7lrNFD9h9mCCq79Wo-BRApOaLUGI1yH0/edit?usp=sharing), create your meetup page, and  start contacting speakers.
- 4 weeks before have your speakers and venue confirmed
- 4 weeks before schedule, but don’t announce
- 2 weeks before announce on meetup and SNS
- 1 week before blog post and SNS promotion, email
- 2 days/day before reminder- continue promotion
- day of reminder & promotion
- day after post photographs and videos on meetup and upload to google drive, thank you to attendees, speakers and venue sent, follow up with your KPIs and Metrics, create meetup event page for your next event, and follow up on Social Media with your videos and photos

## Organizing a meetup event 

1. **Research by attending other meetup events.** See what you like/dislike about what the other groups are doing and take notes. Find what space in your community is lacking and make that your niche. Important for DC, Berlin and NYC where the communities are very active and there are a lot of nice meetups.
2. **Create goals for your meetup and KPIs.** What’s the purpose of your meetup? What’s Wiredcraft’s ROI? (Brand awareness, recruitment, newsletter or SNS subscribers?) What size do you want the meetup to be. 
3. **Know who the influencers/speakers are in your community** and reach out to them to speak/suggestions for speakers. Create a [backlog spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ToSKa_N3IAF4lpEOHP8gCsNGtTjlMiLD6Kp_bgXXMt4/edit#gid=1587452805) so you have all necessary information at your fingertips. 
4. **Find Sponsors/Venues.** Make a list and email them so you can plan your meetups well in advance. Ideally you can plan your first two meetups before you even host the first one.
5. **Meet with the venue.** Important questions - what is there sound system/projector set up (will the speaker need a remote to reach their computer), expected capacity, how many chairs can they provide, area for drinks/food, is it ok to have beer at their venue, who will be responsible for the setup and takedown, are they willing to help sponsor food or anything else? Get their social media and logo for cross promotion. Get their contact number if people can't find the venue.
6. **Create your budget**
7. **Create your meetup on meetup.com.** Make sure the purpose and schedule of your meetup is clear in your objective. Allow some time to gain members, about a month. You can schedule the meetup, but it’s not necessary to announce it yet. 
8. **Promote your event.** Reach out to other partner groups to ask them to promote and support on Social media or at their events. 

**Speakers**
1.How to find them: Your friend circle, design&tech events, feedback from last meetup, linkedin, etc.
2.Ask them to fill in the list
* Links to their previous presentations (if relevant)
* A summary/synopsis of the talk they’d like to present at the meetup.
* A short biography and links to their social media, include any previous speaking experience(s)
* Their social media information - Twitter, Weibo, Linkedin, etc.
3.Collect their ppt before the event.

## How to Use Meetup.com

**Scheduling/Announcing events**
You can schedule an event without announcing it, we schedule two weeks in advanced. Once an event is announced, meetup will send out tons of promotional emails automatically. If you just schedule and don’t announce, people can RSVP if they land on the page but it’s not promoted. 
For scheduling you have many options - 

1. We have [templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnnTaXq8lbQowdtttqWTP5dMSN1MzFrVvN0L8fWy4xY/edit) for what information you should include in the description for each event. 
2. Make sure to ask questions in the scheduling - Ask about Venues, and Speakers. 
3. Limit attendees and open a waitlist, if necessary (Shanghai UI/UX meetup required). Limiting encourages people to sign up so if you want to help grow your numbers add a limit and then increase it if you have the capacity

**Group Tools > Email Members**
**When should you email members?**
- The day after you announce the event 
- Any important changes
- 1week in advance
- 3 days before
- the day before 
- the day of 
- follow up thank you for attendees - with presentation link, and photos
- Call for speakers or call for venues

**More > Files**
This is where I post the PDF of the presentations by the speakers. You can also use some other features like promote and polls but feel free to play around with this. 

**Photos**
You might need to turn your VPN off to get the photos online. We take photos at every event, photoshop them, and put them online for social media promotion and also to be sent to attendees, speakers and venues in the thank you letter. 

## Use local event platform to help promote the meetup events
* Douban Event豆瓣同城
* Huodong Xing 活动行
* Weibo 
* Wechat: we do a 4-article wechat post weekly based on the event schedule, including an announcement of the coming event and a recap of the past event.

### Running the event 
**Before the event**

1. Create a bilingual EMCEE list so you know the schedule and what to do
2. Create a PPT to show while the networking is occurring (usually the schedule and a graphic with Wiredcraft logos - you can ask the designers for this)
3. Print your attendance list, and organize your materials. It might be helpful to make a checklist so you don’t miss anything, see materials list below
4. Make sure your food order and drinks/plates are on track
5. Assign your team roles, who is in charge of drinks and pizza area, sign, photos, and just being a general go to person. 
6. Create a checklist of items you need to bring - promotional materials, sign in sheets, camera, etc... (sample list in last section) 

**For non-speech meetup** 
1. Make sure except for the check-in staff, there's also other Wiredcraft people to break the ice at the beginning. 
2. Set up an introducing part.
3. Encourage people to take their new tech products and represent their new projects

**Day of The event**

1. Get there early and plan for traffic.
2. Check in with the venue organizers and make sure you have everything sorted, also check in what they need cleaned up after the venue - chairs etc.
3. Set up the room if necessary, test the sound, test the projector
4. Set up the Periscope recording
5. Set up your check in table, and set up the ipad to record emails 
6. Get the food area organized
7. Follow up with your speakers

**During the Event**

1. Serve as Emcee and time keeper, stop the speakers if they run over
2. Pitch Wiredcraft in the welcome talk
3. Make sure photos are being taken
4. Give gifts to speaker and run the raffle
5. Check with HR and make sure that you or someone from the team announces the jobs that we are looking for at Wiredcraft

**Day after**

1. Don’t worry if the event was not perfect. Have a post-mortem to decide what was successful and what could be improved on for the next meetup.
2. Record your metrics - attendance, new subscribers etc… 
3. Edit and Upload pictures from the event to Meetup.com, add event picture to venue spreadsheet, add put the images on google drive 
4. Upload presentations to meetup.com
5. Send emails thanking the venue and sponsors, you can ask them if they have any feedback on organization and for them to suggest any other venues/speakers that they might know
6. Send thank you email to the attendees - link to the presentations, job adverts and photos, let them know you will be sending the link to the videos within the next week (make sure you know if you can deliver on this.) Let them know the future meetup date and ask for feedback. (see template)
7. Check the answers and contact anyone that listed their contact information as a speaker or for venues (Use mail merge and a template see instructions below)

// The timeline is for China where things move very fast, and most people decide to come to things last minute. Keep in mind you might need to schedule/promote earlier in different countries. Test this at your meetups and see what is the most successful.

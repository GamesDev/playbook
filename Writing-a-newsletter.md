The newsletter allows our clients to follow up with our latest news, events and loved stuff. The newsletter is sent on the last Tuesday of every months at 2pm Eastern time.

### Structure

1. **Introduction**; a small paragraph (3-4 lines) to introduce this month newsletter.
2. **News**; we are linking to our or devo.ps (cross-polination) blog posts or case studies. Provide a quick overview of the content.
3. **Events**; outline the vents we are part of, will make a presentation or ogranizaing. Provide a quick overview of the events focus (which technology, where, when,etc.).
4. **Useful stuff**; a list of the latest things we are using, platforms we like, interesting reads, etc.

### Do

* Be **straight to the point**, readers do not have hours to get through all the specific of a project.
* **Send it every month** regularity is necessary to have our past clients or partners remembering us.
* **Provide useful or new tools** is a good way to promote the use of the newsletter as clients finding an interesting tool will be more than likely to open the newsletter again.

For the first day of an employee we need to have him join our online platforms, set up his accounts and provide the goodies. Those tasks can only be done by the managers as it requires the credentials of various platforms.

We need to make sure the following is done;

* **Hardware must be ready**
  * Make sure to have the Wiredcraft account as administrator.
  * Create another account with the employee name.
* **Employee swag**
  * Prepare a bag with;
      * a t-shirt,
      * wiredcraft,
      * notebook
* **Create a mail account**
  * In Wiredcraft gmail interface, click on the gear and `Manage this domain`.
  * In the management interface, click on the `Users` tab.
  * Click on `Create new user` and `Add a user manually`.
  * Enter the first and last name and use the first name for the email address *i.e.* `first_name@wiredcraft.com`.
* **Add him to Wiredcraft's repository**
  * Click on the tools to go to the `Account settings` section.
  * Select the Wiredcraft repository.
  * Click on `Members`.
  * Click on `team management`.
  * Click on `Interns & Newbies`.
  * Enter the Github name and click `Add`.
  * Click on `Save Team`.
* **Create a jabber account**
  * Steps to be defined
* **Share the WCL Public Dropbox folder**
  * Right click on the WCL Public folder.
  * Click on `Share folder`. You will be redirected to the Dropbox site.
  * Enter the email address of the new employee Dropbox account.
* **Prepare the first tickets**
  * Make sure the first tickets are ready.
  * If the developer assigning this ticket is not here, make sure to have the assistant or somebody else in the loop.

The big rule here is **always to have somebody to meet the employee**. When the employee is in the office we have to;

* **Take a picture for the website**
  * We need to have diffuse light (direct creates shadows).
  * White background.
  * A few pictures with different angles (right, left, front).
  * Upload those pictures in `WCL Public > Resources > Pictures`.
* **Make it read through the [Getting started](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/wiredcraft.com/wiki/Getting-started)**
* Give the **pass for the door**.
* Buy a new **Subway card**.
* Give hime a **t-shirt** and **notebook**.

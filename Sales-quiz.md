The aim of the Sales quiz is to create a framework answering most of the questions that need to be answered when starting a new leads.

### Outline

* What is your company name?
* What is your company url, if any.
* How can we reach you? Email, Gchat, Skype, phone number(s), etc.

### Project information

* What is your company looking to do?
* What is your target market? Country, population, etc.
* Why did you pick this idea to work on?
* Do you have domain expertise in this area?
* How do you know people need what you're making?
* What's new about what you're making?
* What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
* Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
* What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
* How do or will you make money, if any? How much could you make? (We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
* If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
* How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in users or revenue or both)?
* If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it; just use an obscure url.)
* How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

### Liabilities

* Are any of the parts of the project covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with what we will work on? Will any be working as employees or consultants for anyone else?
* Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your team members? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.)

### Additional information
* If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.

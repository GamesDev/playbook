*This document outlines the various steps to hiring a new staff. This process usually heavily involves operations (COO and assistant).*

## tl;dr

* **Answer people fast** (good people are hired quickly).
* **Recruiters own the process** (if you need somebody on your team, you'd better make sure this person gets hired... quickly).
* Work with operations staff.

## Advertising about the new position

We're always recruiting and are running weekly ads for various positions. If you're in need of additional staff, you should come up with two things:

1. What will that person do?
1. What skills do we expect that person to have?

This should be enough for the person in charge of HR (operations staff) to post a job ad on our site and other various mediums (Reddit, job boards...). It is recommended however that you advertise about it through your own personal channels (Twitter, Google+, friends...): **more often that not, we find good candidates through personal connections.**

There are examples of existing ads in this wiki; re-use at will.

## The application process

1. Application are received by email through job@wiredcraft.com or jobs@wiredcraft.com (which is what you'll have ). If you want to receive emails sent to these aliases, ask operations.
1. On reception of such email, we automatically
    1. create a Github issue labeled `HR` that contains the body of the email. We should be dropping any attachment to this email (likely CVs) in our Dropbox (`WCL Admin › HR › Applications`).
    1. Send an email to the applicant to confirm reception of his email and ask for a few more details in case he did not send them to us yet (expected salary, Github account...).
1. The recruiter (likely to be one of the manager) is in charge of confirming the need for an interview and should make sure it happens as fast as possible.

## The offer process

* After an interview, the recruiter is expected to leave his comments in the related issue queue.
* **Candidates should be informed that we are likely to answer to them within 72 hours. Recruiters should stick to this timeframe: again, good candidates are quickly taken off the market.**
* Offers can be made based on the salary grid (see *Sidenotes*) and should be reviewed by the COO.

## Sidenotes

* **Try and answer candidates within 48 hours**; good applicants don't stay available for long.
* A few things to keep in mind when reviewing applicants:
    * We are likely to not hire people asking for more than 15K right away, unless they have exceptionally good fit and skills.
    * We don't relocate people, unless they're exceptionally good candidates (in which case we'd likely have them work remotely anyway).
* We're likely to offer the following types of salaries (on top of other pers/compensations):

    Type | Experience | Salary range
    --- | --- | ---
    **Senior** | 2+ years | 10K+
    **Medium** | 1 ~ 2 years | 5K ~ 7K
    **Junior** | < 1 year | 5K ~ 7K

    The usual delta on medium and junior types is 20%, depending on exceptional fit (personally and technically).
